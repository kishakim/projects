# Background


**Objectives**
Through our research, we wanted to answer the following questions:
* Did the Covid-19 impact the housing price change in the past 2 years?
* Did the Covid-19 and the subsequent shift in working styles increase housing prices in suburbs of large cities?


**Data Files**

* WA_COVID19_Cases.csv - number of covid cases by zip code for the past 2 yrears
* NY_COVID19_Cases.csv  - number of covid cases by zip code for the past 2 yrears
* zillow_price_data_by_county.csv - housing prices by county level along with zipcodes data
