# Background
Data was collected across 7 locations in 4 major cities - Vancouver, New York, Chicago and Boston, making 28 individual sites. During the experimentation, half locations were set as control vs treatment via random selection. For treatment, designed signs were laminated and put within a 2m x 2m area of the bin/pole where smokers are able to view. 

**Objective** - Identify causal infererence of having signage on cigarette butt disposal in 4 major US cities
