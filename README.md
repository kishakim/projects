# Projects



1. **Covid_Impact_on_US_Housing_Prices** : This project studied unique patterns of US housing prices that was impacted due to Covid 19.

2. **Flight Delay Prediction** : This project used machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, LightGBM techniques) to predict flight delay prior to 2 hours planned departure time.

3. **Experimentation_CB_Disposal** : This project measured causal inference of putting signage near the smoking area, on the number of
disposed cigarette butts in four US major cities, through designing and conducting randomized/clustered  experimentation.

4. **Fashion_Recommender_System** : This project predicted fashion articles an existing customer would purchase in a 7-day period, using hybrid recommendation algorithm, LightFM (Python Scikit-learn), including data cleansing, model building, hypertuning parameters, and model evaluation

5. **Spotify Podcast Episode Description Summarization** : This project used NLP to summarize spotify podcast descriptions to help listeners find the right content & increase listening time on the platform. 
  
6. **Voter_Difficulty_2020Election** : This project compared difficulties that were faced in the 2020 presidential election, to help better prepare for the upcoming 2024 presidential election, using statistical testing.

7. **Environmental_Impact_on_Pumpkin** : This project identified impacts that temperature and precipiation had on the weight of giant pumpkins and other cucurbits grown in the United States that were entered into the Official competition, using linear regression.
