1. Environmental_Impact_on_Pumpkin : This project identified impacts that temperature and precipiation had on the weight of giant pumpkins and other cucurbits grown in the United States that were entered into the Official competition, using linear regression.

2. Experimentation_CB_Disposal : This project measured causal inference of putting signage near the smoking area, on the number of
disposed cigarette butts in four US major cities, through designing and conducting randomized/clustered  experimentation.

3. Fashion_Recommender_System : This project predicted fashion articles an existing customer would purchase in a 7-day period, using hybrid recommendation algorithm, LightFM (Python Scikit-learn), including data cleansing, model building, hypertuning parameters, and model evaluation

4. Voter_Difficulty_2020Election : This project compared difficulties that were faced in the 2020 presidential election, to help better prepare for the upcoming 2024 presidential election, using statistical testing.
